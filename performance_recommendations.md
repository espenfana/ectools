# Performance Optimization Recommendations for ectools

## 1. Memory Management
- **Large Dataset Handling**: For large folders, consider lazy loading with generators
- **Memory Cleanup**: Explicitly delete large pandas DataFrames after conversion to numpy
- **Data Streaming**: For very large files, implement chunked reading

## 2. Processing Speed
- **Vectorization**: Replace loops with numpy vectorized operations where possible
- **Caching**: Cache parsed metadata and file headers for repeated access
- **Parallel Processing**: Use multiprocessing for folder parsing when dealing with many files

## 3. Data Structure Optimization
- **Numpy Arrays**: Convert data to appropriate dtypes (float32 vs float64)
- **Memory Layout**: Use contiguous arrays for better performance
- **Index Optimization**: Pre-compute frequently accessed indices

## 4. I/O Optimization
- **Buffered Reading**: Use larger buffer sizes for file reading
- **Format Detection**: Cache file format detection results
- **Path Handling**: Use pathlib for cross-platform compatibility

## Implementation Priority:
1. Memory cleanup (immediate impact)
2. Vectorization of cycle detection
3. Parallel folder processing
4. Lazy loading for large datasets
